Help on function __init__ in module openwakeword.model:

____iinniitt____(self, wakeword_model_paths: List[str] = [], class_mapping_dicts: List[dict] = [], enable_speex_noise_suppression: bool = False, vad_threshold: float = 0, custom_verifier_models: dict = {}, custom_verifier_threshold: float = 0.1, **kwargs)
    Initialize the openWakeWord model object.

    Args:
        wakeword_model_paths (List[str]): A list of paths of ONNX models to load into the openWakeWord model object.
                                          If not provided, will load all of the pre-trained models.
        class_mapping_dicts (List[dict]): A list of dictionaries with integer to string class mappings for
                                          each model in the `wakeword_model_paths` arguments
                                          (e.g., {"0": "class_1", "1": "class_2"})
        enable_speex_noise_suppression (bool): Whether to use the noise suppresion from the SpeexDSP
                                               library to pre-process all incoming audio. May increase
                                               model performance when reasonably stationary background noise
                                               is present in the environment where openWakeWord will be used.
                                               It is very lightweight, so enabling it doesn't significantly
                                               impact efficiency.
        vad_threshold (float): Whether to use a voice activity detection model (VAD) from Silero
                               (https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad) to filter predictions.
                               For every input audio frame, a VAD score is obtained and only those model predictions
                               with VAD scores above the threshold will be returned. The default value (0),
                               disables voice activity detection entirely.
        custom_verifier_models (dict): A dictionary of paths to custom verifier models, where
                                       the keys are the model names (corresponding to the openwakeword.models
                                       attribute) and the values are the filepaths of the
                                       custom verifier models.
        custom_verifier_threshold (float): The score threshold to use a custom verifier model. If the score
                                           from a model for a given frame is greater than this value, the
                                           associated custom verifier model will also predict on that frame, and
                                           the verifier score will be returned.
        kwargs (dict): Any other keyword arguments to pass the the preprocessor instance
